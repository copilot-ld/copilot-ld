    <h1>Copilot-LD Teams App</h1>
    <h5>An intelligent agent leveraging GitHub Copilot and Linked Data</h5>
    <p>
      Traditional RAG systems treat knowledge as plain text, leading to
      responses based on text similarity rather than actual meaning. Copilot-LD
      is different: it uses structured linked data to understand relationships
      and context, delivering responses grounded in your knowledge graph—not
      just matching keywords.
    </p>
    <p>
      This MS Teams app assumes that you have a Copilot-LD Agent deployed and
      accessible. The app connects to your agent to provide intelligent
      assistance directly within Microsoft Teams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before you can use the Copilot-LD Teams app you need to configure it to
      point to your organisation's Copilot-LD Agent.
