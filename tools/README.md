# Tools Directory

This directory contains optional protobuf definitions for custom tools that can
be used with the Tool service.

It also contains small, optional workspace packages used for development and
smoke testing (for example, `tools/mcp-server`).

For detailed documentation on creating, configuring, and registering tools,
please refer to the [Implementation Reference](../docs/reference.md).
