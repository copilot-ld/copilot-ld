# Documentation Instructions

## Purpose Declaration

This file defines simple documentation standards for this project to ensure that
`README.md`, `docs/configuration.html`, `docs/architecture.html`,
`docs/development.html`, and `docs/deployment.html` remain current and
synchronized with all code changes across the platform.

## Core Principles

1. **Six-File Documentation**: This project maintains `README.md`,
   `docs/configuration.html`, `docs/architecture.html`, `docs/processing.html`,
   `docs/development.html`, and `docs/deployment.html` as official documentation
2. **Domain-Specific Documentation**: Each piece of information must exist in
   exactly ONE place. Carefully consider which guide is the authoritative source
   for each topic and use cross-references to avoid duplication
3. **Single Source of Truth**: Configuration, processing, architectural
   concepts, and deployment procedures must be documented in their respective
   domain-specific guides with other guides referencing these authoritative
   sources
4. **Component Changelogs**: Each component in `extensions/`, `packages/`, and
   `services/` must maintain a simple `CHANGELOG.md` in descending chronological
   order
5. **Present Tense Only**: All documentation must describe the current state
   using simple present tense. Never reference previous states, past
   configurations, or what has changed (changelog files are the only exception)
6. **Synchronous Updates**: Documentation updates must accompany code changes in
   the same commit or pull request
7. **Simple Maintenance**: Keep documentation updates straightforward and
   focused on essential information
8. **Valid JavaScript Code Blocks**: All JavaScript code blocks in Markdown must
   be complete, valid, and pass ES linting with strict configuration
9. **üö® CRITICAL: Spellcheck Strategy üö®**: Use different approaches for
   different types of terms:
   - **Code Elements**: Format programming symbols (variable names, class names,
     method names, property names), file names, directory names, and API/service
     names with inline markdown code blocks using backticks (`` `symbol` ``)
   - **Real Words**: Add proper nouns (company names like "OpenAI"), standard
     English words (like "proxying"), and established technical terminology to
     `.dictionary.txt`
   - **Never mix approaches**: Don't add code elements to dictionary, don't use
     backticks for real words

## Implementation Requirements

#### Component CHANGELOG.md Requirements

Each component in `extensions/`, `packages/`, and `services/` must maintain a
`CHANGELOG.md` file with this exact format:

```markdown
# Changelog

## 2025-01-02

- Fixed issue in `validateInput()` where `null` values caused errors
- Enhanced `APIClient` to support new `retryOptions` parameter
- Updated `README.md` with installation instructions

## 2025-01-01

- Added new `processData()` method to `DataProcessor` class
- Updated `config.yml` with new `timeout` setting
- Version bump to `v1.2.0`
```

**Format Rules**:

- Single top-level `# Changelog` heading
- Date headings in `YYYY-MM-DD` format using `## ` - **MUST use today's date
  when adding new entries**
- Simple bullet points for each change
- Descending chronological order (newest first)
- Updates must be added when component code changes
- **üö® CRITICAL: Spellcheck Strategy üö®**: All programming symbols (classes,
  methods, variables, properties), file names, service names, and technical
  identifiers must be formatted with backticks: `` `ClassName` ``,
  `` `methodName()` ``, `` `fileName.js` ``, `` `ServiceName` `` - **NEVER add
  programming symbols to `.dictionary.txt`**. Real words (company names,
  standard English terms) should be added to `.dictionary.txt` instead.

### Update Requirements

When making code changes, update documentation in the same commit:

#### Adding New Components

When adding services, packages, extensions, or scripts:

1. Create a `CHANGELOG.md` file in the component directory using the required
   format
2. **Determine Domain Ownership**: Carefully consider which documentation file
   should be the authoritative source for the new component
3. Update `docs/configuration.html` if the change adds new configuration options
4. Update `docs/architecture.html` to include the new component
5. Update `docs/processing.html` if the change affects knowledge base processing
   or data management workflows
6. Update `docs/development.html` if the change affects local development setup
7. Update `docs/deployment.html` if the change affects deployment procedures
8. Update `README.md` if the change affects quick setup or usage
9. **Add Cross-References**: Include references from other guides to the
   authoritative documentation instead of duplicating information
10. Ensure component descriptions are clear and accurate
11. If you add or change `.proto` files, document required `npm run codegen`
    steps in `docs/architecture.html` and verify generated files are committed
    when appropriate

#### Modifying Existing Components

When changing existing functionality:

1. Add entry to component's `CHANGELOG.md` with current date
2. **Identify Domain Owner**: Determine which documentation file is the
   authoritative source for the affected functionality
3. Update `docs/configuration.html` if the change affects configuration options
4. Update `docs/architecture.html` if the change affects system design or code
   generation
5. Update `docs/processing.html` if the change affects knowledge processing or
   data management
6. Update `docs/development.html` if the change affects local development setup
7. Update `docs/deployment.html` if the change affects deployment procedures
8. Update `README.md` if the change affects quick setup or core usage
9. **Update Cross-References**: Verify that references from other guides still
   point to the correct authoritative sections
10. Verify all references remain accurate across all documentation files
11. If you modify `proto/*.proto`, update any code samples in the authoritative
    `docs/architecture.html` and ensure references from other guides remain
    valid

### JavaScript Code Block Standards

All JavaScript code blocks must be complete, valid, and pass ES linting:

- **Complete Functions**: Include full function definitions with proper imports
- **Executable Examples**: Code must run without modification
- **No Placeholders**: Avoid `...`, `// TODO`, or incomplete implementations
- **ES Linting**: Use `const`/`let` appropriately, include proper imports,
  handle errors

**‚úÖ CORRECT Example:**

```javascript
/* eslint-env node */
import { ServiceConfig } from "@copilot-ld/libconfig";

class ExampleService {
  constructor(config) {
    if (!config) throw new Error("config is required");
    this.config = config;
  }

  async processRequest(request) {
    const result = await this.performOperation(request);
    return { success: true, data: result };
  }

  async performOperation(request) {
    return `Processed: ${request.input}`;
  }
}
```

**‚ùå INCORRECT Example:**

```javascript
/* eslint-disable no-undef */
class ExampleService {
  processRequest(request) {
    // TODO: implement
    return result; // undefined variable
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### Documentation Timing

- Update `README.md`, `docs/configuration.html`, `docs/architecture.html`,
  `docs/processing.html`, `docs/development.html`, and `docs/deployment.html` in
  the same commit as code changes
- **Domain-First Updates**: Always update the authoritative documentation file
  first, then update cross-references in other files
- Include documentation updates in pull request descriptions
- Reference specific documentation sections in commit messages
- Create documentation drafts before implementation begins
- Review documentation changes during code review process
- When `.proto` changes are included, call out the need to run `npm run codegen`
  in the PR description

### Documentation Quality

- Use present tense for current capabilities: "provides", "handles", "processes"
- **Never reference past states**: Document only what the system currently does,
  not what it used to do or what changed (except in changelog files)
- Be specific about system components and data flows
- Keep descriptions clear and concise
- Focus on essential information that helps users and developers
- Include version information for breaking changes
- Maintain consistent terminology across both files

### Cross-Reference Maintenance

- Verify all component references in `docs/architecture.html` match actual
  implementations
- Ensure setup instructions in `README.md` work with current code
- Validate that usage examples reflect current functionality
- Ensure configuration documentation in `docs/configuration.html` is complete
  and current
- Ensure development setup in `docs/development.html` is complete and accurate
- Verify deployment procedures in `docs/deployment.html` work with current
  infrastructure
- Check that all service names match proto definitions
- Verify port numbers and configuration options are current
- Ensure dependency lists are complete and accurate

### Documentation Validation

Before committing, verify:

1. `README.md` accurately describes current functionality
2. `docs/configuration.html` contains complete configuration documentation
3. `docs/architecture.html` reflects actual system design
4. `docs/processing.html` provides complete processing pipeline documentation
5. `docs/development.html` contains complete development setup instructions
6. `docs/deployment.html` provides accurate deployment procedures
7. **No Information Duplication**: Each piece of information exists in exactly
   one authoritative location with appropriate cross-references
8. **Cross-References Work**: All links between documentation files point to
   valid sections and remain accurate
9. Setup and usage instructions are current and functional
10. Component descriptions match implementation
11. All external links are functional and relevant
12. Code examples compile and execute successfully
13. All JavaScript code blocks pass ES linting with strict configuration

### Documentation Maintenance Workflows

#### For New Feature Development

1. **Planning Phase**: Draft documentation changes before coding
2. **Implementation Phase**: Update documentation incrementally with code
3. **Testing Phase**: Validate documentation examples work as described
4. **Review Phase**: Include documentation in code review process
5. **Release Phase**: Final documentation review and publication

#### For Bug Fixes

1. **Identify Documentation Impact**: Determine if fix affects user behavior
2. **Update Relevant Sections**: Modify affected documentation sections
3. **Verify Examples**: Ensure code examples still work correctly
4. **Update Troubleshooting**: Add new known issues if applicable

#### For Refactoring

1. **Assess Documentation Scope**: Identify all affected documentation
2. **Update Component References**: Modify service and package names
3. **Revise Architecture Diagrams**: Update system interaction patterns
4. **Validate Cross-References**: Ensure all internal links remain valid

## Explicit Prohibitions

### Forbidden Documentation Practices

1. **DO NOT** duplicate information across multiple documentation files -
   establish a single authoritative source and reference it from other locations
2. **DO NOT** leave outdated references in `README.md`,
   `docs/architecture.html`, `docs/processing.html`, `docs/development.html`, or
   `docs/deployment.html`
3. **DO NOT** implement new components without carefully determining which
   documentation file should be the authoritative source
4. **DO NOT** create additional documentation files beyond the six official
   files
5. **DO NOT** add detailed instructions to guides that should reference other
   domain-specific guides instead
6. **DO NOT** document implementation details that should be in code comments
7. **DO NOT** omit documentation updates when making functional changes
8. **DO NOT** create cross-references that bypass the authoritative
   documentation source

### Alternative Approaches

- Instead of duplicating information ‚Üí Establish single authoritative sources
  with cross-references from other guides
- Instead of outdated references ‚Üí Update documentation in the same commit as
  code changes
- Instead of missing documentation ‚Üí Include documentation updates in every
  functional change
- Instead of additional files ‚Üí Use the six official documentation files for all
  documentation needs
- Instead of detailed instructions in wrong guide ‚Üí Reference the
  domain-specific authoritative guide (e.g., Configuration Guide for setup,
  Processing Guide for knowledge base work)
- Instead of implementation details in docs ‚Üí Keep high-level descriptions in
  documentation, details in code
- Instead of separate documentation commits ‚Üí Bundle documentation with code
  changes
