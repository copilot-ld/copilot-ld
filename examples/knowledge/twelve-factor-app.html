        <p itemprop="description">
          The twelve-factor app is a methodology for building
          software-as-a-service apps that use declarative formats for setup
          automation, have a clean contract with the underlying operating
          system, are suitable for deployment on modern cloud platforms, and can
          scale up without significant changes to tooling, architecture, or

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          In the modern era, software is commonly delivered as a service: called
          web apps, or software-as-a-service. The twelve-factor app is a
          methodology for building SaaS apps that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use declarative formats for setup automation</li>
          <li>Have a clean contract with the underlying operating system</li>
          <li>Are suitable for deployment on modern cloud platforms</li>
          <li>Minimize divergence between development and production</li>
          <li>
            Can scale up without significant changes to tooling, architecture,
            or development practices
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 itemprop="name">I. Codebase</h2>
        <p itemprop="text">
          One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys. A
          twelve-factor app is always tracked in a version control system, such
          as Git, Mercurial, or Subversion. A copy of the revision tracking
          database is known as a code repository, often shortened to code repo
          or just repo.

          code, which is a violation of twelve-factor.

          a build.

          is the array of processes that are used to do the app's regular
          business. Separately, developers will often wish to do one-off
          administrative or maintenance tasks for the app.

        <p>
          The twelve-factor methodology provides numerous benefits for modern
          application development:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Portability:</strong> Applications can run on any cloud
            platform
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Scalability:</strong> Applications can scale horizontally
            with minimal changes
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Maintainability:</strong> Clear separation of concerns makes
            code easier to maintain
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reliability:</strong> Stateless processes and proper error
            handling improve reliability
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Deployment:</strong> Continuous deployment becomes possible

          The Twelve-Factor App methodology was created by Adam Wiggins,
          co-founder of Heroku. It draws on experience with hundreds of
          Software-as-a-Service applications and represents a synthesis of best
          practices for app development.
