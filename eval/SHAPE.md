## Relationship Patterns

### Multi-Hop Relationships (3-5 hops required)

- **Organizational Hierarchy**: HQ → Department → Team → Team Lead → Team Member
- **Course Prerequisites**: Foundation → Intermediate → Advanced → Certification
- **Policy Hierarchy**: Master QMS → Category Policy → Specific Procedure
- **Drug Development Pipeline**: Lead Compound → Phase I → Phase II → Phase III
  → Approval
- **Technology Platform Dependencies**: Core Platform → Integrated System →
  Advanced Module

### Example Longest Traversal Paths (5+ hops)

These example paths demonstrate the deepest relationship chains that must be
traversable in the evaluation system:

#### Drug Development Journey (6 hops)

```
Immunex-Plus (combination drug)
  → requires Immunex (base drug)
    → tested in Phase II Clinical Trial
      → conducted at Medical Organization (trial site)
        → managed by Asclepius (Clinical Director)
          → reports to Minerva (R&D Director)
            → reports to Zeus (CSO)
```

**Test Query**: "Trace the development and approval chain for Immunex-Plus from
compound to executive oversight"

#### Technology Stack Integration (6 hops)

```
AnalyticsHub (business intelligence platform)
  → requires DataLake (data warehouse platform)
    → requires DataPipeline (data integration platform)
      → requires CloudOps (cloud infrastructure platform)
        → managed by Cloud & Infrastructure Team
          → led by Helios (Cloud Infrastructure Manager)
            → reports to Gaia (CTO)
```

**Test Query**: "What infrastructure dependencies does AnalyticsHub require and
who manages them?"

#### Cross-Functional Project Path (7 hops)

```

  → has member Chronos (R&D Drug Discovery Senior Scientist)
    → works on Oncora (oncology drug)
      → tested in Phase III Clinical Trial
        → requires Manufacturing facility validation
          → overseen by Quality Assurance Team
            → led by Justitia (QA Manager)
              → reports to Hephaestus (Manufacturing Director)
```

**Test Query**: "How does Project Alpha connect R&D drug discovery to
manufacturing quality oversight?"

#### Compliance Policy Chain (5 hops)

```
Specific GMP Manufacturing Procedure
  → isPartOf GMP Compliance Category Policy
    → isPartOf Master Quality Management System Policy
      → satisfies FDA Compliance Framework
        → enforced by Regulatory Affairs Team
          → led by Themis (Regulatory Director)
```

**Test Query**: "Trace the policy hierarchy from specific manufacturing
procedures to FDA compliance oversight"

#### Educational Certification Path (5 hops)

```
Advanced Bioinformatics Course (BIOS-401)
  → requires Intermediate Bioinformatics Course (BIOS-301)
    → requires Foundation Bioinformatics Course (BIOS-201)
      → enables Data Science Career Path
        → pursued by IT/Data Science Team members
          → led by Uranus (Data Science Manager)
```

**Test Query**: "What prerequisite courses lead to advanced bioinformatics
certification and which team benefits?"

## Usage Guidelines for Prompt Authors

1. **Reference STORY.md and SHAPE.md**: All content generation prompts must
   reference the BioNova storyline and this shape file
2. **Maintain Entity Names**: Use exact names specified for people, drugs,
   technology platforms, projects, departments
3. **Preserve Quantities**: Generate exact numbers of entities specified (120
   people, 7 drugs, 12 platforms, etc.)
4. **Keep Relationships**: Maintain organizational hierarchy, project
   membership, drug pipelines, platform dependencies
5. **Vary Content Only**: Change descriptions, technical details, and narrative
   content - not structure
6. **Respect Distribution**: Allocate items correctly between vector, graph, and
   hybrid categories
7. **Test Both Approaches**: Ensure generated content works for both vector
   similarity and graph traversal
8. **Pharmaceutical Context**: All content must be appropriate for
   pharmaceutical industry setting

The goal is to create multiple demo datasets that have **identical structure**
but **different content**, enabling consistent testing of the platform's
capabilities across various scenarios in the pharmaceutical domain.
